## Integration with Elasticsearch

The steps for configuring Elasticsearch as an uberAgent backend are captured in the [documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/uberagent/7-3-0/installation/backend/installing-elasticsearch). 

Metrics and logs stored in Elasticsearch can be visualized through Kibana dashboards. Pre-built dashboards are provided to visualize uberAgent metrics.
