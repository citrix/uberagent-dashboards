## Integration with Azure Monitor

uberAgent can be configured to send the collected data to Microsoft Azure Monitor (Log Analytics).    
The configuration steps are captured in the [documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/uberagent/7-3-0/installation/backend/configuring-microsoft-azure-oms-log-analytics).

Different tools can then be used to visualize the collected and stored metrics. Pre-built dashboard definitions can be found for
* Azure Workbooks
* Grafana
* PowerBI
